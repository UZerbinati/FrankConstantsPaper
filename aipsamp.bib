abstract = {A modification of the Boltzmann equation is described in which the rotational motion of nonspherical molecules is considered classically. This Boltzmann equation leads to equations of continuity, motion, and energy balance similar to the equations applying when the molecules are spherical. An additional equation of change arises, however, because of the conservation of angular momentum in collisions. (When the molecules are spherical, this equation is redundant.) Associated with the additional equation of change, there appears an additional ``macroscopic variable'' related to the local density of angular momentum due to the rotational motion of the molecules and an additional flux vector representing the flux or transport of this angular momentum. The Boltzmann equation is solved by a perturbation method similar to the Chapman-Enskog first approximation, and expressions are obtained for the various flux vectors and transport coefficients. Although the equations of change apply under more general conditions, the present treatment is restricted to molecules which may be idealized as rigid nonspherical bodies in which the center of mass is a center of symmetry.},

abstract = {A generalized Boltzmann equation for fluids composed of molecules with arbitrary internal degrees of freedom and which interact according to classical mechanics through arbitrary, noncentral pair-additive forces is developed using techniques similar to those used by Hollinger and Curtiss. Several special cases are considered: (1) molecules which interact only through impulsive forces of repulsion, (2) molecules for which the only internal degrees of freedom are rotational degrees, and (3) a combination of both special cases. The third special case leads to a Boltzmann equation appropriate to a fluid composed of rigid nonspherical molecules, and provides a firm basis upon which to develop a formal kinetic theory. As a special example we consider a gas made up of rigid, convex, nonspherical molecules with symmetric-top mass distributions. Rigorous equations of hydrodynamics are presented for such a fluid. It is shown that the kinetic theory of a dilute multicomponent system of these molecules is formally the same as that for the loaded-sphere system recently studied by Dahler and Sather. Finally, it is shown how the methods developed by these authors can be applied to the problems of solving the Boltzmann equation and of calculating the transport coefficients for the nonspherical molecular species considered in the present paper.},

abstract = {"There are two main approaches to the theoretical study of liquid crystals: continuum and molecular. The first, well covered in various good books (e.g. those by Chandrasekhar [1992]; de Gennes and Prost [1993]; Virga [1994]; Kleman and Lavrentovich [2003]; Stewart [2004]; Oswald and Pieranski [2005, 2006]; Barbero and Evangelista [2006]) considers anisotropic systems at macroscopic level and typically deals with optical and elastic properties as well as with many practical electrooptical applications of liquid crystals. At continuum level, liquid crystals are assumed to exist and their properties (e.g. elastic constants and viscosities) to be known, insofar as they are needed to parameterize the relevant equations. Molecules, phase transitions and spectroscopic properties are not normally taken into consideration. In this line of work computer simulations typically refer to a determination of the preferred orientation (director) or of the ordering tensor field that minimize the elastic free energy under a variety of boundary conditions, while dynamics is normally related to the solution of hydrodynamics equations for anisotropic fluids. The other main line of investigation deals"-- Provided by publisher.},

abstract = {Optical measurements by one of the authors on two nematogens (5CB and MBBA) under pressure have provided information from which it is possible to deduce (a) how volume varies with pressure and temperature, (b) how the conventional nematic order parameter, here written as varies with temperature at constant volume, and (c) how both the nematic-isotropic transition temperature Tc and the order parameter at the transition temperature S2c change when the specimen is compressed. Comparable, though less extensive, results for a third nematogen, PAA, have previously been published by McColl & Shih. Our values for γ (= — d ln Tc/d ln V)are significantly different from theirs, however, being 6 for 5CB and 2.6 for MBBA, as opposed to 4. We also find that for both 5CB and MBBA S2c decreases significantly on compression, where McColl & Shih observed no such effect. We compare our results in some detail with predictions based upon a number of mean field theories of nematic order, all of them elaborations of the well-known theory of Maier & Saupe; they are summarized in § 5 of the paper. None of these theories is in satisfactory agreement with all the data, despite the extra adjustable parameters which they contain. However successful they may appear to be when compared with data for S2 obtained at constant (atmospheric) pressure, they cannot be fitted to our curves for (SM.S.2 — S2), the deviation of S2 from the Maier-Saupe value, at constant volume, though it is at constant volume that one would expect the theories to work best. It is also difficult to reconcile the theories with the fact th at if the nematic-isotropic transition could be constrained to take place at constant volume the molar entropy, for both 5CB and MBBA, would increase by only about 0.09 N ^ kB; this may be deduced from the slope of the transition line, dTc/dp, taken in conjunction with some of our volumetric data. Most mean field theories imply that the only orderdependent term in the entropy is the entropy of misalignment and that this should increase at the transition by more than 2.27 S22c, which is two or three times larger than 0.09 N ^ kB.The discrepancy can only be removed by the introduction of yet another ad hoc adjustable parameter, such as the cluster size in the cluster model which some authors have advocated. The paper includes, in an appendix, a comparison between different methods which have been suggested for calculating the local field in a nematic.},
